# Introduction
In this repository implementation of the following computer vision algorithms is presented:
* Visual Background Extractor described in "ViBE: A powerful random technique to estimate the background in video sequences" by Olivier Barnich and Marc Van Droogenbroeck

# Visual Background Extractor
Here is performance comparison of ViBE from this library and MOG2 (Mixture of Gaussians based background extractor) from opencv under different noise environments:

The performance of ViBE for noise video sequence can be improved with median filter.
